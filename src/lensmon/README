INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS for VERSION 1.5
=========================================
  0. NB: This version will by default only compile tdelays.c, which
     takes two input light curves and finds the delay between them
     via the Pelt et al. method.

  2. Decide where your executable is going, and modify the BINDIR line
     in the "configure" file.
     *** NB: In this simplified version, you shouldn't need to change
         the values of PGDIR and X11DIR in the configure file ***

  3. Run the configure file with the appropriate operating-system flag.
     There are currently four options:

       ./configure sun4-gcc
       ./configure sol2-gcc
       ./configure linux-gcc
       ./configure apple-osx-gcc

     See the notes in the "configure" file for more explanation.

  4. Actually compile the program.
     Type "./makeall".

  5. Type "rehash" -- now you are ready to go

  6. You can test out tdelays by using the two demonstration data
     sets in this directory.  Just type

       tdelays demo1.dat demo2.dat

     Just choose the default values when prompted.  You should get
     a best-fit time delay of around -32 days, with a best-fit
     magnification ratio around 0.5.

  7. For help with tdelays, just type the program name on
     the command line and hit return.
